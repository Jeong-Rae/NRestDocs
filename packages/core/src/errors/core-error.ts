/**
 * base class for all custom errors in the project.
 *
 * Provides a common structure for all runtime errors in NRestDocs.
 * It separates a *reason* (what went wrong) and a *suggestion*
 * (how the user can fix it).
 *
 * @remarks
 * - `context` is the identifier of the module, method, file, etc. where the error occurred.
 * - `reason` is the core message that the user needs to know.
 * - `suggestion` is the action guide that the user needs to take to fix the problem.
 * - `data` can contain arbitrary additional information for debugging.
 * - `code` is a string for error category identification.
